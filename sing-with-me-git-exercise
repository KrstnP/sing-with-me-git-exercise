True Colors
Cyndi Lauper


[Verse 1]
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
Its hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small


[Chorus]
But I see your true colors
Shinning through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow


[Verse 2]
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw your laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there


[Chorus]
And I'll see your true colors
>>>>
I see your true colors
>>>>
>>>>
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
>>>>


(Whisper)
Can't remember when I last saw you laugh

If this world makes you crazy
>>>>
>>>>
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors
>>>>
I see your true colors
>>>>
So don't be afraid to let them show
>>>>
True colors

I see your >>>>
And that's why I love you
So >>>> to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are >>>>>
Like a >>>>
